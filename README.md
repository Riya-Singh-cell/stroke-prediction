# Stroke Prediction Project 

**Welcome to the Stroke Prediction project!**

This machine learning model predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on healthcare data. It uses a Random Forest Classifier, handles data imbalance with SMOTE, and provides detailed evaluation with accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance visualizations.
